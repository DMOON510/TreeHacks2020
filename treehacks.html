<p class="paragraph">Our website displays a real-time map that informs visitors on which galleries are better to visit based off of foot traffic. Musevue utilizes Google Cloud's Vision API technology to count the number of people in front of each exhibit using intermittent images of galleries. We created Musevue because we believe museums are important institutions for cultural education. We hope that our site can streamline visitors' experiences and make the art that they encounter more impactful. </p>

    <img src="/images/persistence of memory_dali.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p> Salvador Daliâ€™s The Persistence of Memory depicts melting pocket watches and a central abstract figure on a barren landscape. Its unique and uncanny, otherworldly feel marks it as one of the most recognizable works of Surrealism.

      <h3>TRENDING</h3>
      <img src="/images/office in a small city_hopper.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200" class="cards"/>
      <p>Office in a Small City, by  Edward Hopper, fits with the realist genre of painting. It depicts a simple scene of a man sitting in an office surveying the outdoor landscape. Its style is like other works by Hopper in the sense that they successfully capture the feeling of loneliness in a stark and beautiful way. (1953)
